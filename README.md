# Conversio

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> This is a basic social media app created using the MERNG stack after following <a href="https://github.com/hidjou">@hidjou</a>'s tutorial. Furthermore, some additional features have been added. I am not great with js, so kindly ignore the redundant and messy code. The app is live at <a href="conversio.netlify.com/">Conversio</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> Clone the repository using :
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/InvincibleJuggernaut/Conversio.git
  ```
  </p>
  
  <p> Once inside the downloaded directory, install the required modules using:
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  </p>
