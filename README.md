<h2>:warning: NOTE</h2>

<p><b> This project is no longer being maintained by me. The sheer number of security vulnerabilities in the dependencies and alerts being generated by Github's Dependabot is quite overwhelming. Keep that in mind if in the off chance, you wish to clone this project or use it as a base.</b></p>
<p> Due to inactivity, the live app is no longer working as expected. I will try to restore it if possible.</p>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> This is a basic social media app created using the MERNG stack after following <a href="https://github.com/hidjou">@hidjou</a>'s tutorial. Furthermore, some additional features have been added namely profile section for all the users with their previous posts and a suggestion section for suggesting other users. I am not great with JavaScript, so kindly ignore the redundant and messy code. The app is live at <a href="https://conversio.netlify.com/">Conversio</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>
